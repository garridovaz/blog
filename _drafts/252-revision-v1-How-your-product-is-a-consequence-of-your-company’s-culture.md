Think of your favorite product for a moment. &nbsp;Consider how it makes you feel when you use it. Now think about how you feel about the company that makes this product. Chances are, those feelings are close to each other.

In which direction does this work? Is it the product that feels like the company behind it, or vice versa? And most importantly, does it matter?

I think it does. As you’re building your teams, which values do to let your people know are important to you? How will they take that into consideration in the many product decisions that teams face every day.&nbsp;

How your product “feels” the same way your company does.
