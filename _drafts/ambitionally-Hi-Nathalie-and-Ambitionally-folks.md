If I could be any animal, Iâ€™d be a dog. Not any dog, though, I&#8217;d be one of my dogs. These guys have fun &#8211; check out this video of them playing at home. They are surrounded with people that love them, and they get plenty of opportunity to do stuff they like.

          You said standard, boring cover letters would not be accepted, so I guess you&#8217;re asking for it ðŸ™‚
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Let me introduce myself. My full name is Fernando Garrido Vaz. I am currently 37, married, two daughters ages 6 and 2 and a boy on the way. I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lages">Lages</a>, in the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)">Santa Catarina</a> in Brazil. It&#8217;s the second southernmost state of the country, and it&#8217;s up in the mountains, so occasionally it snows here &#8211; did you know that about Brazil?

          I have lived in England twice &#8211; from 1980 to 1981 and from 1990 to 1994. That&#8217;s where I learned to speak English, so sometimes I might use more letters than normal to spell things. But the real reason I mention this is that <a href="http://blog.garridovaz.com/playing-conkers-and-building-products/">living abroad as a teenager shaped who I am today</a>. Being a stranger and a foreigner makes you very good at adaptation. Also, as an immigrant you end up meeting lots of other immigrants, and you learn that there are lots of different ways to go about life and to do the same things you do, and they all work, even though sometimes they&#8217;re very different. This sense of empathy and of seeing a situation through someone else&#8217;s eyes has become a useful skill. I also learned how to play cricket, though that has been less useful.

          Nowadays I really love staying at home with my family, playing with my two dogs (an elderly Schnauzer and a very young Golden Retriever), and trying to play the blues on my acoustic guitar. You can read some more about things that I care about by heading over to <a href="http://blog.garridovaz.com">my blog</a> or to my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/garrido">Twitter account</a>.

          With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to it&#8230;

        </p>
        
        <p>
          As you can see from my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMxvk8oimJ8Z1hXMHZtY2RwZGc">resume</a> and my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogarridovaz">LinkedIn profile</a>, I have been working in Product roles since 2009. I have never been in a Customer Success role, even though I have interacted with users and with people in Customer Success teams. So, what am I doing here applying for a Customer Success role?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You see, the most important task in building great products is figuring out which problems people most need to solve, and then solving them in the simplest possible way. And the way to figure that out is by talking to people. So, Customer Success is the entry point for information that will feed into product development. I have done product development, and I thoroughly enjoy it, but I think I will be a more complete professional if I have an experience working directly with Customer Success.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So, being very open, I fail to deliver on two of your requirements:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            2-3 years in a customer support role
          </li>
          <li>
            Familiarity with the Nathalie Lussier brand and AmbitionAlly products (being a customer/user is a major plus!)
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          However, I run my own blog and I have built multiple WordPress sites for clients, so I am sure I can quickly overcome those limitations. And, on the other hand, I think I over-deliver by bringing in Product experience that will both help me adapt quickly to the role and might be useful further down the road. I once started my own business to take care of other small to medium business&#8217; online activities, so I strongly relate to Ambitionally&#8217;s vision.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Positive interactions with people are always easier to quote. One sure way to make people happy is to deliver a very fast response when you identify an issue that can be solved with little to no effort. When I ran my own business, I made sure that all of these quick requests were handled immediately as they came in, which always positively surprised people. And, when it was not possible to fix things immediately, I made sure to provide a human (not automated) response within a few minutes, to reassure people that an actual person read their request and it would be handled adequately.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As an example of a not-so-positive interaction with clients, I can quote an example from my experience as Software Engineering Manager at JobScore. We had one customer request that we do a fairly large change to some of the records in their account. I told them we&#8217;d do it, but in actually executing the migration we found out we&#8217;d actually need to make some changes to how that specific feature worked, otherwise we would end up breaking things in the product. The customer was not happy because it meant her request would take a long time to be ready. I had to explain to her what the change was that we were making to the product and highlight that it was being designed to avoid the exact problem that was causing us to have to do this large migration. After some explaining, the customer was actually happy that we were changing how the product worked to address one of her needs &#8211; even though it was actually a general need for all clients.

          I am way behind on watching movies, having two young daughters does that to you &#8211; though I can tell you the full names of all the characters from Peppa Pig. The last great movie I watched was &#8220;The Martian&#8221;, which was fantastic as it hits all the right &#8216;science geek&#8217; chords. I was actually a physics student for a while. I cannot forget, obviously, Star Wars &#8211; The Force Awakens. I am a huge fan of the franchise, and I am currently staring at half a dozen Lego Star Wars ships and figures in my home office. I watched the first session at midnight, and I think the movie did a great job of anchoring itself on the strong past of the series while creating a really good story to carry things along for another run.

          Why Ambitionally? Well, it seems to be a business that is well positioned in a growing market and, importantly, it has strong personal leadership. This makes it ideal for me for two reasons. First, I want to be a part of a growing business, help contribute to that growth and look back in five years and see how far we&#8217;ve come. Secondly, as I said earlier this is not the usual job application. I am trying to transition to a new area, and learn new skills. I am confident I can leverage my existing experience to hit the ground running, but in order to do that, I need the business to trust that I can do it. And that is easier to do when there is a single leader with a strong vision that you can talk to, rather than going through a bunch of recruiters that will cut me off in their first review of my resume.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As for salary requirements, in my last full-time job I made US$5600 per month. As a freelancer, my rate varies between US$45 and US$35, depending on the number of hours I am hired for. Since this is a bit of a career move, I am open to negotiation. I&#8217;ve worked for a company based in Austin, Texas before, and our time difference varies between two and four hours, depending on the time of the year, so it should be easy to have a lot of overlap.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I truly believe I can contribute with my existing experience and eagerness to exercise a new role. I would be very energized in a new position, and the combination of previous experiences and motivation for this change will be successful. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get the opportunity to talk and find out if this crazy idea has worked &#8211; I certainly hope so!
