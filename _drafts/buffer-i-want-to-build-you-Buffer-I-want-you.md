Hi, Buffer folks! My name is Fernando, a Product Manager living in Brazil, and a big Buffer fan. This is the third time I apply for a Product position at Buffer &#8211; that&#8217;s how much I like your products and what your company stands for. I believe life is a journey, circumstances change, and if our paths haven&#8217;t merged in the past they might still do at some point.

Rather than sending a plain old &#8220;cover letter&#8221;, this time, I thought I&#8217;d put up a page explaining who I am and showing you a little bit of the path that brought me here and why I want to join the team. I apologize if this becomes a bit verbose, but I think this is a better way to get to know me than from the traditional means. I do have a more [traditional resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMxvk8oimJ8Z1hXMHZtY2RwZGc) and a [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogarridovaz) which you&#8217;re welcome to look at as well. 

First of all, let me tell you a little about myself. My full name is Fernando Garrido Vaz. I am currently 37, married, and I have two daughters ages 6 and 2 and a boy on the way. I live in [Lages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lages), in the state of [Santa Catarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)) in Brazil. It&#8217;s the second southernmost state of the country, and it&#8217;s up in the mountains, so occasionally it snows here &#8211; did you know that about Brazil?

I have lived in England twice &#8211; from 1980 to 1981 and from 1990 to 1994. That&#8217;s where I learned to speak English, so sometimes I might use more letters than normal to spell things. But the real reason I mention this is that [living abroad as a teenager shaped who I am today](http://blog.garridovaz.com/playing-conkers-and-building-products/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator). Being a stranger and a foreigner makes you very good at adaptation. Also, as an immigrant you end up meeting lots of other immigrants, and you learn that there are lots of different ways to go about life and to do the same things you do, and they all work, even though sometimes they&#8217;re very different. This sense of empathy and of seeing a situation through someone else&#8217;s eyes has become a useful skill. I also learned how to play cricket, though that has been less useful.

Nowadays I love staying at home with my family, playing with my two dogs (an elderly Schnauzer and a very young Golden Retriever), and trying to play the blues on my acoustic guitar.

          I got bitten by the product bug in 2009 when the project management consultancy I worked at decided to build a project management web app. Since I was the local &#8220;tools expert&#8221;, running deployment projects for enterprise project management tools, I was chosen to be the Product Owner for this new product. The challenge of building a new product entirely from scratch, including the product vision, technology selection, hiring the development team, setting up the development process, was incredibly fun, and I am proud of having been a part of the original team that turned <a href="http://www.artia.com">Artia</a> into a commercial success.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Since then, I have kept working in Product roles, and I have learned a lot about the value of listening to your users and of having <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html">strong opinions, weakly held</a>, and of <a href="http://blog.garridovaz.com/heres-how-you-become-data-driven-in-six-easy-steps/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator">backing them up with data</a>. For the past four years, I have worked entirely remotely and have built <a href="http://blog.garridovaz.com/how-to-get-remote-right/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator">my own opinions about how to make that work</a>. At least from the outside, it seems like Buffer nails all of that.

          As Buffer grows from a product into a mature business with a portfolio of products that must be nurtured within the same brand, each with its own challenges and maturity levels, it will become increasingly important to bring on board people who can contribute to that growth without losing this culture of openness, transparency and collaboration which is so important and ends up reflecting in the products and in how the brand is perceived. I would love to be a part of that, and I think I can make a relevant impact. I am looking forward to being able to talk to you about the kind of contribution I can make to the team.
