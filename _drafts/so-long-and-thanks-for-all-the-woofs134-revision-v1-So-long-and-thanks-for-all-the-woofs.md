I am taking my dog to be euthanized tomorrow. This is probably the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done. I am crying as I write this. This is also supposed to be a professional blog, but screw it, there&#8217;s a human being behind the professional and this human is in need of a little &#8220;writing therapy&#8221;.

She would turn fourteen next July. When I got her, my wife and I had been dating for one year. I have turned from a careless young man into a father of three, with quite a few adventures along the way. She was always there.

My daughters will come home from school shortly, and we&#8217;re going to tell them. They will get to say goodbye to their friend.

I cannot imagine a strongest, purest kind of friendship and loyalty. I will always remember my truest friend. Rest in peace.

Please give your dog a hug for me today.
