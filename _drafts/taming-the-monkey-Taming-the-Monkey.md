If you want to 

I&#8217;d like to share my experiences in how to survive, and perhaps even thrive, when your life turns upside down. I will start by stating that I have learned it is very easy to create a new habit. What&#8217;s hard is keeping it when the Chaos Monkey decides to pay a visit. 

If you&#8217;re into tech you might already be familiar with the Chaos Monkey. If you&#8217;re not, allow me to explain. Netflix runs, as you might imagine, on an extremely complex infrastructure. There are literally hundreds of services running on hundreds, perhaps thousands, of servers. A while back, Netflix decided to start testing the reliability of their systems. They created a service that intentionally shuts down parts of their infrastructure so that they can observe how the system as a whole behaves when failures happen. They called this the [&#8220;Chaos Monkey&#8221;](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html).

So, back to creating habits. A few months ago, the Chaos Monkey was only peeking around the corner, as I had switched back to freelancing earlier in the year and was getting back into the flow of things in this working arrangement (which, BTW, pleases me very much). I started going for daily walks with my dog, back then a ten month old Golden Retriever. The dog had to spend energy, I had to stop being completely sedentary, so it seemed we had an arrangement that was good for both of us.

As it turned out, walking is really good. As in, quite life-changing good. It gave me a very good start to the day, as I had time to organize my thoughts and plan my future work &#8211; some blog posts, my newsletter and my (upcoming) online course were all born during these walks. The walk also gave me a good jolt of endorphin that made me much more focused and productive during the rest of the day. 

There is no such things as a &#8220;Walk Keeper&#8221; app (or at least I don&#8217;t think there is), so I used Runkeeper and let it think I was a very slow runner. I listened to some really good podcasts &#8211; Poornima&#8217;s Femgineer TV, David Kadavy&#8217;s Love Your Work, and Tim Ferriss&#8217; podcast (the episode about morning habits became a daily inspiration).

Then, the Chaos Monkey struck.

My third (and final) child was born, which by the very nature of these things was expected by this time. After a month or so, we decided to move to a new house &#8211; which was voluntary, but not expected. Not only that, I also started a new full-time position as a Product Manager for Upwork, so I also had a new job to ease into. So my pretty, productive routine the likes of which I hadn&#8217;t had in a long time was shred to pieces. Walking daily was no longer a possibility, and keeping up with my new job was hard enough that any side projects were put aside.
