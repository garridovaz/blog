When should you launch your product? By _launch_ I mean make it generally available to the public. 

This topic was brought to my attention recently when I installed the Android version of [Lift](http://lift.do), the personal motivational app. The app clearly still has a lot of rough edges, and other people have noticed too as evidenced by some of the reviews in Google&#8217;s Play Store. In a reply to one of these negative reviews saying the product was unfinished, a person identifying themselves as &#8220;one of Lift&#8217;s co-founders&#8221; said:

> I now use this version as my primary Lift experience, which is what prompted me to release it.

Which sounds reasonable enough. However, obviously this person has a vested interest in the app and might be unknowingly much more accepting of the app&#8217;s shortcomings than a regular user, which is a behavior that a product&#8217;s team needs to be acutely aware of. In the case of Lift, in my opinion the big feature that&#8217;s missing are notifications. The whole point of using an app to help me form a new habit is to have that app remind me to do things, and if I don&#8217;t get notified of these new tasks I will certainly forget about them.

Lift was launched as an iOS app, and apparently that is where it shines. It has a 4+ rating on the App Store and extremely positive reviews.

When you&#8217;re building your product, there are different kinds of MVPs and I believe it&#8217;s important to recognize where you fit as each of them requires different strategies. Below are some of these categories, though of course others also exist.

##### Proof-of-concept MVPs {#proofofconceptmvps}

This kind of MVP is designed to (as the name implies) demonstrate what your product is about. It does not need to be finished, it does not need to be production-ready, but it does need to allow people to understand the core idea behind the product. In a sense, this MVP goes for _breadth_ rather than _depth_ &#8211; it gives an overview of what the product wants to achieve without necessarily showing a lot of polish on individual features. If you plan to get this out to real users, you need to either carefully select your users so people know what they&#8217;re getting into, or you need to communicate really well which stage of development the product is currently at, or your users may complain about lack of functionality, bugs, or just lack of polish.

##### Marketable MVPs {#marketablemvps}

##### App platform ports {#appplatformports}

This is the category into which Lift&#8217;s example falls. An app which is fully established in a certain platform is made available on another platform. Here there are different options. If you have a large number of requests and you prefer seing to these requests quickly, then you have to be ready to deal with the kind of feedback that Lift on Android has received, and consequently lower ratings to start with. 

An app that took a different approach was Instagram. They took a long time to launch an Android app, but when they did the app was pretty much flawless and the service took on the huge additional load of literally millions of anxious Android users quite well.
