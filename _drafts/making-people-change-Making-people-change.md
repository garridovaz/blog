Stakeholder management is an important aspect of running a project, and it&#8217;s one that is frequently ignored in software development projects.  
I spent the first few years of my career trying to change how people around me worked to what was clearly (to me) the right way of doing things. One soon realises that’s BS. Most of our engineers have not realised that yet, so instead of just making things easier for themselves (as you have said), they just fight back, it’s their “knee jerk” reaction. Lots of wasted energy.  
Basics of stakeholder management. You have to weigh the alternatives &#8211; should I spend time and create stress to do something exactly as I believe is right, or should I just give an important stakeholder 10 minutes every two days and be done with it?
