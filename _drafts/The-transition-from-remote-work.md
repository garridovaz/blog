While the trend towards remote work continues and lots of people compete to get a fully remote job, I found myself in the curious position of doing the opposite &#8211; moving from a remote job to an onsite one. Why, you might ask? It&#8217;s complicated&#8230;

Let me start by describing why remote work is great. Having done it for around seven years, I think I have an opinion. For starters, it was through remote work that I was able to live for several years in a fairly small town together with our &#8220;extended family&#8221; of several aunts, uncles, grandparents, great grandparents and the like. In fact I bumped into remote work by accident, when trying to make it feasible for us to stay in this place to raise our family.
