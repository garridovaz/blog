Hi, 22 Words folks! My name is Fernando, and if you&#8217;re here, my email convinced you to take a closer look at my application. Thanks! Rather than just sending a plain old &#8220;cover letter&#8221;, I thought I&#8217;d put up a page explaining who I am and showing you a little bit of the path that brought me here and why I want to join the team. I apologize if this becomes a bit verbose, but I think this is a better way to get to know me than from the traditional means. I do have a more [traditional resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxMxvk8oimJ8Z1hXMHZtY2RwZGc) and a [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogarridovaz) which you&#8217;re welcome to look at as well.

First of all, let me tell you a little about myself. My full name is Fernando Garrido Vaz. I am currently 37, married, and I have two daughters ages 6 and 2 and a boy on the way. I live in [Lages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lages), in the state of [Santa Catarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)) in Brazil. It&#8217;s the second southernmost state of the country, and it&#8217;s up in the mountains, so occasionally it snows here &#8211; did you know that about Brazil?

I have lived in England twice &#8211; from 1980 to 1981 and from 1990 to 1994. That&#8217;s where I learned to speak English, so sometimes I might use more letters than normal to spell things. But the real reason I mention this is that [living abroad as a teenager shaped who I am today](http://blog.garridovaz.com/playing-conkers-and-building-products/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator). Being a stranger and a foreigner makes you very good at adaptation. Also, as an immigrant you end up meeting lots of other immigrants, and you learn that there are lots of different ways to go about life and to do the same things you do, and they all work, even though sometimes they&#8217;re very different. This sense of empathy and of seeing a situation through someone else&#8217;s eyes has become a useful skill. I also learned how to play cricket, though that has been less useful.

Nowadays I love staying at home with my family, playing with my two dogs (an elderly Schnauzer and a very young Golden Retriever), and trying to play the blues on my acoustic guitar.

I got bitten by the product bug in 2009 when the project management consultancy I worked at decided to build a project management web app. I was chosen to be the Product Owner for this new product. The challenge of building a new product entirely from scratch, including the product vision, technology selection, hiring the development team, setting up the development process, was incredibly fun, and I am proud of having been a part of the original team that turned [Artia](http://www.artia.com) into a commercial success.

Since then, I have kept working in Product roles, and I have learned a lot about the value of listening to your users, of having [strong opinions, weakly held](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html), and of [backing them up with data](http://blog.garridovaz.com/heres-how-you-become-data-driven-in-six-easy-steps/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator). For the past four years, I have worked entirely remotely and have built [my own opinions about how to make that work](http://blog.garridovaz.com/how-to-get-remote-right/?utm_source=job_applications&utm_medium=website-form&utm_campaign=buffer-product-creator). In all of those roles, I have managed projects of various sizes and complexities, often with teams spread out across multiple time zones.

What really motivated me to apply for this position is the fascinating challenge of creating content that people love and build a platform that propels that content to reach as wide an audience as possible. In a time when there is so much competition for our attention, this is a really fascinating problem to work on. It&#8217;s also an area where I believe data-driven optimization really shines, and that&#8217;s something that I learned to love and would be thrilled to do more of.

I am looking forward to being able to talk to you about the kind of contribution I can make to the team.
