We need to communicate ideas all the time, and it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s pretty hard to be good at. Especially when dealing with something abstract, like a software product or a management concept. Often, being able to rely on visuals makes it much easier to get the point across. However, we are not usually trained to do that, and there are all sorts of impediments that we place on ourselves &#8211; oh, but I can&#8217;t draw a thing! However, you don&#8217;t need any artistic skills to communicate ideas. After all, it&#8217;s not art we&#8217;re talking about, but communication and all that requires is clarity of thought.

One area where visual communication is particularly useful is in designing the visual aspects (the UI) for software products. Being able to convey how a particular screen should look like, be organized or to show the information it should contain is a very useful skill to have and simpler than it looks like if you have the right tools and know some simple tricks on how to use them. Wireframes and mockups with varying degrees of fidelity can be created using conventional tools that you probably already have (such as Apple Keynote) or with very basic knowledge of more powerful tools such as Adobe Illustrator (and its open source counterpart Inkscape) or Axure.

Wireframes and mockups are useful for showing a particular state in your product. However, they are poor choices for showing movement across an app and how things flow. There are some diagramming conventions that make it very easy to depict that, and it&#8217;s quite easy to draw those flows using, again, familiar tools such as Apple Keynote, Illustrator or Inkscape.

Illustrations and images can also be used to back up written or oral presentations on any topic you need to get across. Being able to put together very simple images to help explain a complex subject can save you a lot of time and confusion when trying to convince your audience.

Storytelling is a fantastic way to present your ideas and using images to reinforce your stories make them all the more compelling. This can be achieved either by a careful selection of existing images or by creating very simple diagrams that require little artistic skill. In fact, the &#8220;roughness&#8221; of an amateur sketch can add more flavour and character to a story, making it feel even more authentic.

There are many, many ways in which we can express ideas visually to help us get our point across. All it takes is some knowledge of the techniques and tools involved, and breaking down some barriers that we create for ourselves whenever we think of doing anything &#8220;artistic&#8221;. I am very interested in this topic and am embarking on a journey to learn more about that. Are you with me?
