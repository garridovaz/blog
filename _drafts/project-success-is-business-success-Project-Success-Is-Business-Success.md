How do you measure project success? A lot of people will argue that the ultimate measure of a project&#8217;s success, at least for a team working on developing a product, is to have users strongly adopt whatever it was your project built for them. But how would you measure that?

On a recent &#8220;process coaching&#8221; engagement with a client, one of the things I set out to determine was how team members figured out if the projects they worked on were succesful or not. The ubiquitous answer always involved some element of &#8220;if the feature we built is being used by the end users&#8221;. This prompted the follow-up question &#8220;how can you tell?&#8221;. Overwhelmingly people responded &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. The general feeling, and I&#8217;m sure this can be generalized to many other software companies, is that once a feature is released out in the wild it immediately runs off into the bushes and we lose all contact with it. Sometimes we may get anecdotal evidence from customer care or acount managers, who may receive an email from a particularly enthusiastic customer if something was built _really_ right. But these are just glimpses, and they are the exception rather than the rule.

But anyway, what is the point in having software developers know if what they built is being used? Imagine two different scenarios in which teams of inmates are put to work sewing soccer balls:  
* One group of inmates sews the balls, and they have no clue what happens to them &#8211; they simply stack them at the back of a truck and they are taken away.  
* Another group sews balls, but the are allowed ot watch soccer games on TV and they know it&#8217;s the balls they have sewn that are being used.

If there is an understanding that developers should know that what they built is being used or not, how do you go about doing that?

Certainly there are also other measures of project success, and their importance varies depending on who you ask and on the nature of the project. Ask a CFO and you will hear &#8220;budget&#8221; mentioned a lot. Ask a CTO and you will hear things like &#8220;stability&#8221; and &#8220;regressions&#8221;. Ask a sales person and you will hear about schedule. Ask a CEO and you will hear all of those together.
