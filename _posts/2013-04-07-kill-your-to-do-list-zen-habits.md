      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><h3>The One Thing System</h3>
    

Here’s what I do, and highly recommend to anyone willing to break free of the to-do list:

  1. I wake up in the morning, and decide what One Thing I’m excited about.
  2. Then I focus on doing that, pushing everything else aside, clearing distractions, and allowing myself to get caught up in the moment.

I don’t worry what else is on my list, because there’s only One Thing on my list. I don’t have to check anything off, because I don’t actually have a list. I don’t have to worry about things not getting done, because I do the only thing I want to do — if I didn’t want to do it, it wouldn’t be my One Thing.

If I happen to finish my One Thing early, I can slack off for the rest of the day (my favorite strategy), or I can pick my next One Thing.</blockquote>

    <p>Como será que funcionaria essa no dia a dia de trabalho?  Gosto de simplicidade, mas será que consigo ir tão longe?</p></div>
