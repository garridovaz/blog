Things I like the most from the list (in no particular order):

  * Decide core KPIs for projects at Zapier
  * Learn a new skill to fill in a gap on your team
  * Use Sketch/Photoshop/etc. to design user flows and wireframes
  * Do support at Zapier
  * Dream up the future of Zapier, inspire and motivate your teammates

Things I like the least:

  * Manage your team&#8217;s tasks on a weekly basis
  * Commit HTML or JS code directly to our main repo
  * Ship good looking CSS directly to our main repo
  * Own technical context about how Zapier works
  * Interview and decide from a list of Product Managers to hire

For &#8220;compliance&#8221; purposes, I have also added these to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/garridovaz/9bfefb64fabf73e56932).

And that&#8217;s it for the questions asked in the job posting. I would be very happy to have the chance to speak and get to know Zapier better. I again apologise for being very verbose, but hopefully, this enabled the application to become somewhat more personal and for you to get a better idea of who I really am, much more so than you can by reading a resume.
