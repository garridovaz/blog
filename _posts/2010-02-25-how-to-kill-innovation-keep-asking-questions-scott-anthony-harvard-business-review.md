    Resource-rich companies have the &#8220;luxury&#8221; of researching and researching problems. That can be a huge benefit in known markets where precision matters. But it can be a huge deficit in unknown markets where precision is impossible and attempts to create it through analysis are quixotic. Entrepreneurs don&#8217;t have the luxury of asking &#8220;What about&#8230;&#8221; questions, and in disruptive circumstances that works in their favor.

  <p>
    So what&#8217;s the alternative? Substitute early action for never-ending analysis. Figure out the quickest, cheapest way to do something market-facing to start the iterative process that so frequently typifies innovation. Be prepared to make quick decisions, but have the driver of the decision be in-market data, not conceptual analysis. In other words, go small and learn. Pitch (or even sell) your idea to colleagues. Open up a kiosk in a shopping mall for a week. Create a quick-and-dirty website describing your idea. Be prepared to make quick decisions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The future can&#8217;t be analytically derived. Of course it&#8217;s almost always valuable to think comprehensively about a new idea. But maintain a healthy balance between analysis and action. If you get stuck in &#8220;What about&#8230;&#8221; loops, you&#8217;ll never get the results you seek.

At&eacute; a HBR j&aacute; entendeu isso, e tem tanta gente que continua dando tiro no p&eacute;, perguntando, perguntando, perguntando&#8230;

E olha outra p&eacute;rola que saiu nos coment&aacute;rios do mesmo post:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
  <p>
    &#8230;by the time everything about a potential market is described by solid fact there is no longer an opportunity for economic profit from that market.
