> ### The One Thing System
> 
> Here’s what I do, and highly recommend to anyone willing to break free of the to-do list: 
> 
>   1. I wake up in the morning, and decide what One Thing I’m excited about.
>   2. Then I focus on doing that, pushing everything else aside, clearing distractions, and allowing myself to get caught up in the moment.
> 
> I don’t worry what else is on my list, because there’s only One Thing on my list. I don’t have to check anything off, because I don’t actually have a list. I don’t have to worry about things not getting done, because I do the only thing I want to do — if I didn’t want to do it, it wouldn’t be my One Thing.
> 
> If I happen to finish my One Thing early, I can slack off for the rest of the day (my favorite strategy), or I can pick my next One Thing.

How would this work in a daily work routine? I like simplicity, but is it viable to go this far?
